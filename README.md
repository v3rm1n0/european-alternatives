# European Alternatives

**Discover European and open-source alternatives to US tech giants.**

A community-curated directory that helps you find software and services built in Europe — with privacy, transparency, and digital sovereignty at their core.

> Your data. Your rules. Your continent.

## Why This Exists

Big Tech dominates the tools we use every day — email, cloud storage, messaging, search. Most of these services are US-based, subject to US jurisdiction, and built on business models that treat user data as a product.

Europe has strong privacy laws (GDPR), a growing open-source ecosystem, and talented developers building real alternatives. But finding them is hard. They're scattered across blog posts, Reddit threads, and word of mouth.

**European Alternatives** brings them together in one place. This project exists to:

- **Promote digital sovereignty** — keep your data under European law and jurisdiction
- **Champion privacy-first services** — built with GDPR compliance from the ground up
- **Support open-source software** — transparent, auditable, and community-driven
- **Strengthen the European tech ecosystem** — give visibility to homegrown innovation

This is not about nationalism. It's about choice, transparency, and building a healthier tech landscape.

## Features

- **Browse by category** — Email, Cloud Storage, Messaging, AI, Payments, and 14 more
- **Filter by country, pricing, and open-source status** — find exactly what you need
- **Category-specific fit filters** — refine one selected category by product-fit facts while keeping `Unverified` results visible by default
- **Trust Score (1-10) + vetting status** — transparent scoring with reservations and confidence level
- **Search across all alternatives** — matches names, descriptions, tags, and replaced services
- **Grid and list views** — switch between compact overview and detailed display
- **Shareable category and search filters** — category and search term are stored in the URL; category-specific fit filters stay local to the current browse session
- **Responsive design** — works on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **No tracking, no cookies** — the site itself respects the privacy it advocates for

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20.19.0+
- npm

### Local Development

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/TheMorpheus407/european-alternatives.git
cd european-alternatives

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the dev server
npm run dev
```

The site will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

### Other Commands

```bash
npm run build     # Type-check and build for production
npm run preview   # Preview the production build locally
npm run lint      # Run ESLint
npm run test      # Run tests (vitest)
```

## Trust Method

Each listing includes:
- Trust Score (1-10)
- Trust Tier (Excellent, Good, Fair, Poor)
- Trust Confidence (High, Medium, Low)
- Vetting Status (vetted approved, research profile, or vetted rejected)
- Reservations (specific caveats with severity)

Scoring is deterministic and evidence-weighted:
- Rewards European jurisdiction, open-source transparency, and privacy/self-hosting signals
- Applies reservation penalties by severity
- Uses vetted outcomes (reservations, positive signals, scoring metadata) stored in the database and served via the PHP API
- Keeps non-vetted entries visible with lower confidence so coverage stays broad while certainty stays explicit

Full formula is implemented in `src/utils/trustScore.ts`. Scoring constants live in `src/data/scoringConfig.ts`.

## Contributing

Contributions are what make this project grow. Whether you want to **add an alternative**, **fix a bug**, **improve the design**, or **suggest a new category** — you're welcome here.

See [**CONTRIBUTING.md**](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full guide, including:

- How to add a new European alternative (the most common contribution)
- How to contribute code and design changes
- Coding standards and commit conventions
- Design system guidelines

We use a transparent [**Decision Matrix**](DECISION_MATRIX.md) to evaluate every proposed alternative. Not every entry makes it in — those that fail our vetting process are documented with full reasoning and sources in [**DENIED_ALTERNATIVES.md**](DENIED_ALTERNATIVES.md).

The fastest way to contribute: [open an issue](https://github.com/TheMorpheus407/european-alternatives/issues/new?template=new-alternative.yaml) with the alternative details. Maintainers will add it to the database.

In short: you can use, modify, and distribute this software freely, but any modified version that runs as a network service must also make its source code available. This ensures the project and its derivatives remain open.
