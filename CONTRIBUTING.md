## Communication Guidelines

A constructive, fact-based environment helps everyone — contributors, maintainers, and users alike. Please keep these principles in mind when opening issues, commenting on PRs, or participating in discussions.

- **Facts over emotions** — Technical and objective criticism is highly valued. Vague terms like "trash" or "failure" are not actionable. Instead, provide data, logs, or links to reputable sources (e.g., [Exodus Privacy](https://exodus-privacy.eu.org/), [Kuketz Blog](https://www.kuketz-blog.de/)).
- **Stay within project scope** — This repository evaluates software alternatives based on privacy and digital sovereignty. Keep feedback relevant to that mission.
- **Provide context** — When pointing out flaws (e.g., external CDN usage or third-party font loading), reference specific technical details or legal rulings (e.g., GDPR cases) so maintainers can prioritize effectively.
- **Respect volunteers** — All contributors work on this project in their spare time, for free. Treat everyone with respect.
- **Structure your feedback** — For proposals and bug reports, state the **problem**, provide **evidence**, and suggest a **solution**. This helps maintainers act on your input quickly.

## Adding an Alternative

The easiest way to suggest a new alternative is to [open an issue using the "New alternative" template](https://github.com/TheMorpheus407/european-alternatives/issues/new?template=new-alternative.yaml). Fill in what you know — most fields are optional — and maintainers will take it from there.

If you'd like to contribute directly via a pull request instead of an issue, you can submit a PR that includes the alternative details listed below. A maintainer will add the entry to the database on your behalf. Alternative data is stored in a MySQL database and served via a PHP API -- there are no TypeScript data files to edit.

### Step 1: Prepare the Information

Gather the following about the alternative:

| Field              | Required | Example                                                  |
|--------------------|----------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `id`               | Yes      | `"nextcloud"` (URL-safe, lowercase, unique)              |
| `name`             | Yes      | `"Nextcloud"`                                            |
| `description`      | Yes      | 1-2 sentences describing what it does                    |
| `website`          | Yes      | `"https://nextcloud.com"`                                |
| `country`          | Yes      | Two-letter code: `"de"`, `"fr"`, `"nl"`, etc.            |
| `category`         | Yes      | One of the [existing categories](#available-categories)  |
| `replacesUS`       | Yes      | `["Google Drive", "Dropbox"]` — US services it replaces  |
| `isOpenSource`     | Yes      | `true` or `false`                                        |
| `pricing`          | Yes      | `"free"`, `"freemium"`, or `"paid"`                      |
| `tags`             | Yes      | `["privacy", "self-hosted", "GDPR"]` — relevant keywords |
| `logo`             | No       | SVG file — see logo requirements below                   |
| `sourceCodeUrl`    | No       | `"https://github.com/nextcloud/server"`                  |
| `foundedYear`      | No       | `2016`                                                   |
| `headquartersCity` | No       | `"Stuttgart"`                                            |
| `license`          | No       | `"AGPL-3.0"`                                             |
| `reservations`     | No       | Known concerns — see [Trust Scoring](#trust-scoring)     |

`sourceCodeUrl` can point to any public repository host (GitHub, Codeberg, GitLab, Forgejo, or self-hosted Git).

**Trust scores are computed automatically.** You do not need to provide a trust score. New alternatives will show "Trust Score Pending" until they are vetted by a maintainer. If you know of documented concerns, mention them in your issue or PR -- see the [Trust Scoring](#trust-scoring) section for the reservation format.

### Step 2: Submit the Entry

**Option A (recommended):** [Open an issue](https://github.com/TheMorpheus407/european-alternatives/issues/new?template=new-alternative.yaml) with the details above. A maintainer will add it to the database.

**Option B:** Open a pull request that includes the alternative details in the PR description (using the fields above). If you have a logo, you can include it in the PR as well.

You do **not** need to edit any TypeScript source files. All alternative data lives in the database.

### Step 3: Add a Logo (Optional but Recommended)

- Place an SVG file in `public/logos/` (e.g., `public/logos/nextcloud.svg`)
- SVG is strongly preferred for quality and file size
- Keep logos under 50 KB
- If you can't find an SVG, the site will fall back to the country's flag icon — so no logo is fine too

### Step 4: Verify

If you're contributing a logo file via PR, make sure:
- The SVG is placed in `public/logos/` with the alternative's `id` as the filename (e.g., `nextcloud.svg`)
- The file is under 50 KB
- `npm run build` and `npm run lint` still pass

Don't see a fitting category? You can [propose a new one](#adding-a-new-category).

### Supported Countries

All country codes below are valid in the type system. Note that the browse page's country filter currently shows a popular subset — alternatives from any valid country will still appear in unfiltered results and text search.

**EU Member States:** AT, BE, BG, HR, CY, CZ, DK, EE, FI, FR, DE, GR, HU, IE, IT, LV, LT, LU, MT, NL, PL, PT, RO, SK, SI, ES, SE

**Other European:** CH, NO, GB, IS

**Non-European (Tier 2):** Currently US, CA in the type system — but the policy allows any jurisdiction not listed in Tier 1, provided the entry is **fully open-source** (client and server code under an OSI-approved license; see [DECISION_MATRIX.md](DECISION_MATRIX.md)). To add an alternative from a new Tier 2 country, extend `CountryCode` in `src/types/index.ts` first.

**Multi-country:** `eu` (for pan-European services)

---

## Adding a New Category

If an alternative doesn't fit any existing category, you can propose a new one by [opening an issue](https://github.com/TheMorpheus407/european-alternatives/issues).

Category definitions are stored in the database and served via the API. Contributors cannot add categories directly. When proposing a new category, include:

- **ID** — URL-safe, lowercase, kebab-case (e.g., `your-new-category`)
- **Name** — Human-readable name (e.g., "Your Category Name")
- **Description** — Brief description of what the category covers
- **US Giants** — Which US services this category replaces (e.g., "US Service 1, US Service 2")
- **Emoji** — A representative emoji for the category

Maintainers will also need to add localization entries in `src/i18n/locales/{de,en}/data.json` and update the `CategoryId` type in `src/types/index.ts`.

The filter component in `src/components/Filters.tsx` dynamically reads categories from the API, so no UI changes are needed when a new category is added.

---

## Trust Scoring

Every alternative on the site has a trust score (0-10). These scores are computed automatically by the Alignment v2 scoring engine -- you never hardcode them.

### How It Works (Overview)

Trust scores are built from two components:

1. **Base alignment score** -- determined by jurisdiction and open-source status (e.g., a fully open-source project scores higher than a proprietary EU company, which scores higher than a US company).

2. **Operational score** -- computed across four dimensions, each with its own maximum:

   | Dimension       | Max Points | What It Covers                                              |
   |-----------------|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
   | **Security**    | 12         | Audits, disclosure processes, encryption, vulnerability handling |
   | **Governance**  | 8          | Ownership clarity, legal transparency, regulatory compliance |
   | **Reliability** | 6          | Uptime track record, incident response, maintenance maturity |
   | **Contract**    | 6          | Data portability, cancellation terms, lock-in risk          |

   Each dimension starts at 50% of its maximum. **Reservations** (documented concerns) subtract points. **Positive signals** (verified strengths like certifications or audit results) add points back. The effective score per dimension is clamped between 0 and the dimension maximum.

Scoring constants live in `src/data/scoringConfig.ts`. Positive signals and reservations are stored in the database and served via the API.

### What Contributors Need to Know

**You do not need to compute trust scores.** When you add a new alternative, it will display "Trust Score Pending" on the site until a maintainer or scoring agent vets it with a full deep-research review.

If you know about a concern worth documenting (e.g., a past data breach, a restrictive license change, or a privacy incident), you can add a **reservation** to your entry. Here's the format:

```typescript
reservations: [
  {
    id: 'past-data-breach-2023',
    text: 'Suffered a data breach in March 2023 affecting 50,000 accounts.',
    textDe: 'Datenpanne im Maerz 2023 mit 50.000 betroffenen Konten.',
    severity: 'major',
    date: '2023-03-15',
  },
],
```

The fields you should provide:

| Field       | Required | Description                                                       |
|-------------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `id`        | Yes      | Unique kebab-case identifier for the reservation                  |
| `text`      | Yes      | English description of the concern                                |
| `textDe`    | No       | German translation (maintainers can add this later)               |
| `severity`  | Yes      | `minor`, `moderate`, or `major` -- based on impact, not tone      |
| `date`      | No       | ISO date (`YYYY-MM-DD`) if the concern is tied to a specific event |
| `sourceUrl` | No       | Link to a reputable source documenting the concern                |

### What Contributors Should NOT Do

- **Don't assign penalty tiers or amounts** -- the `penalty` field on reservations (which maps concerns to scoring dimensions like `security` or `governance`) is handled by maintainers and scoring agents. Just provide the reservation with a severity.
- **Don't assign trust scores manually** -- scores are always computed by the engine.
- **Don't add positive signals** -- these require vetted deep-research documents and are managed in the database by maintainers.

### Severity Guidelines

| Severity     | When to Use                                                             | Examples                                              |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `minor`      | Low-impact caveat, worth monitoring but not alarming                    | Optional telemetry enabled by default, minor ToS quirk |
| `moderate`   | Meaningful trust cost, but mitigable or partially addressed             | Past incident with good response, limited data export  |
| `major`      | Structural or high-impact risk                                          | Data breach, hostile license change, ownership opacity  |

## Code Contributions

For bug fixes, features, and improvements to the application itself.

### Before You Start

1. **Check existing issues** — someone might already be working on it
2. **Open an issue first** for large changes — let's discuss the approach before you invest time
3. **Small PRs are better** — easier to review, faster to merge

### Architecture Overview

Understanding the codebase will help you contribute effectively:

- **URL is the source of truth** for category and search filters. These are derived from `useSearchParams()`, not local React state.
- **Local state** is used for non-URL filters (country, pricing, open source toggle, category-specific fit filters), sort order, and view mode.
- **Category-specific fit filters** appear only when exactly one category with comparison data is selected. They compose with global filters, keep `Unverified` results visible by default, and reset or become inactive when users leave that single-category context.
- **`latestParamsRef`** prevents stale reads when multiple URL updates happen in the same tick.
- **`setSearchParamsRef`** avoids dependency array issues with `useCallback`.
- **Logo fallback** — all logo `<img>` elements have an `onError` handler that switches to a country flag icon.
- **Animation delays** are capped at 1 second via `Math.min()` to prevent sluggish rendering on large lists.

## Design Contributions

The design system is implemented in a single CSS file (`src/index.css`, ~1800 lines) using CSS custom properties. Contributions that improve visual quality, accessibility, or responsive behavior are very welcome.

### Design Principles

1. **Dark theme** — the entire UI uses a dark color scheme with high contrast text
2. **Accessibility first** — WCAG AA minimum, AAA where possible
3. **Mobile-first** — default styles target mobile, enhanced via `min-width` media queries
4. **Minimal motion** — animations are subtle and functional, not decorative
5. **Consistent spacing** — use the spacing scale (`--spacing-xs` through `--spacing-2xl`)

### Color System

| Variable             | Value            | Usage                                           |
|----------------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `--bg-primary`       | `#0d0d11`        | Page background                                 |
| `--bg-card`          | `#1a1a1f`        | Card surfaces                                   |
| `--accent-primary`   | `#6c35de`        | Purple — links, active states, focus rings      |
| `--accent-secondary` | `#ff6b35`        | Orange — highlights, labels                     |
| `--accent-gradient`  | Purple to Orange | Headlines, button backgrounds, brand expression |
| `--text-primary`     | `#f0f2f5`        | Main text                                       |
| `--text-secondary`   | `#d0d2d5`        | Descriptions                                    |
| `--text-muted`       | `#9a9ca0`        | Metadata, disabled text                         |
| `--success`          | `#10b981`        | Free/open-source badges                         |
| `--warning`          | `#f59e0b`        | Freemium badges                                 |

### Typography

- **Oswald** — headings, navigation, labels (uppercase, 600 weight, tight line-height)
- **Roboto** — body text, descriptions (400 weight, 1.6 line-height)
- Font size scale: `--font-size-xs` (0.75rem) through `--font-size-4xl` (2.5rem)

### Responsive Breakpoints

| Breakpoint          | Target                   |
|---------------------|--------------------------|
| Default             | Mobile-first base styles |
| `max-width: 480px`  | Small mobile overrides   |
| `min-width: 768px`  | Tablet                   |
| `min-width: 1024px` | Desktop                  |
| `min-width: 1200px` | Large desktop            |

### Accessibility Standards

- All interactive elements must have a minimum touch target of **44px**
- Use `:focus-visible` for keyboard focus indicators (not `:focus`)
- All images need meaningful `alt` text or `aria-hidden="true"` if decorative
- Color must never be the **only** way to convey information
- Use semantic HTML (`<main>`, `<nav>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`)
- Expandable sections need `aria-expanded` and `aria-controls`

### Making Design Changes

1. All styles live in `src/index.css` — there are no component-level CSS files
2. Use existing CSS variables instead of hardcoding values
3. Follow the existing BEM-inspired class naming convention
4. Test on mobile (375px), tablet (768px), and desktop (1200px+)
5. Verify keyboard navigation works for any interactive elements you add

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- **Strict mode** is enabled — all strict checks enforced by `tsconfig.app.json`
- All new data structures must be typed in `src/types/index.ts`
- Use `interface` for object shapes, `type` for unions and aliases
- Unused variables and parameters are compile errors (not warnings)

### React

- **Functional components** only — no class components
- Use `useMemo` for expensive computations (filtering, sorting)
- Use `useCallback` for handlers passed as props
- Prefer controlled components for form inputs
- Use Framer Motion for animations (not CSS animations for interactive elements)

### CSS

- Use CSS custom properties (`var(--...)`) for all colors, spacing, fonts, and transitions
- Follow mobile-first responsive approach (`min-width` media queries)
- Keep specificity low — avoid nesting beyond 2 levels
- No inline styles in React components (except for dynamic values like animation delays)

### General

- No `console.log` in committed code
- No commented-out code blocks
- Prefer descriptive variable names over comments
- Keep components under ~300 lines — extract sub-components if needed

## Commit Conventions

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
<type>: <short description>

2. **Make your changes** — follow the relevant guide above
3. **Test locally** — run `npm run dev`, `npm run build`, and `npm run lint`
4. **Commit** with a clear message following the [conventions above](#commit-conventions)
5. **Open a Pull Request** against `main` with:
   - A clear title describing the change
   - A description of what you changed and why
   - Screenshots if the change is visual
6. **Wait for review** — maintainers will review and may request changes

### PR Checklist

- [ ] `npm run build` passes (no TypeScript errors)
- [ ] `npm run lint` passes (no ESLint warnings)
- [ ] Tested on mobile and desktop viewports (for UI changes)
- [ ] New alternatives have all required fields filled in
- [ ] No hardcoded colors/spacing — CSS variables used instead (for design changes)

## What Makes a Good Alternative

We use a transparent, documented decision framework. For the full criteria (including the two-tier system, gateway checks, and denial triggers), see [**DECISION_MATRIX.md**](DECISION_MATRIX.md). For how trust scores are computed, see the [Trust Scoring](#trust-scoring) section above.

The short version — when adding an alternative, please verify:

- **It's European** — headquartered in a European country (EU, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, UK). Non-European entries are only accepted if they are **fully open-source** (client + server).
- **It's actively maintained** — the service or software is alive and receiving updates
- **It actually replaces something** — it should serve a similar purpose to a US product
- **The information is accurate** — double-check the website, pricing, and open-source status
- **It's not a wrapper** — alternatives should be independent products, not reskins of US services

### We Don't Include

- Services that are European in name only but route data through US infrastructure without transparency
- Abandoned or discontinued projects
- Products in pre-alpha without a usable offering
- Services that are thin wrappers around US platforms with no independent value (see [G4 in DECISION_MATRIX.md](DECISION_MATRIX.md))
- Note: US-hosted infrastructure alone does **not** disqualify a service — it triggers a [reservation](DECISION_MATRIX.md#hosting-transparency-reservation-trigger), not exclusion
- Non-European services that are not fully open-source (see [DECISION_MATRIX.md](DECISION_MATRIX.md) for rationale)
- Services with serious trust, legal, or sanctions concerns (documented in [DENIED_ALTERNATIVES.md](DENIED_ALTERNATIVES.md))
